## GitHub's Topics
As GitHub explains in its [About topics page](https://help.github.com/articles/about-topics/) "With topics, you can explore repositories in a particular subject area, find projects to contribute to, and discover new solutions to a specific problem."

Therefore, we **request** our members to use topics in our repositories as a way to link its subject area, language, team or important derived information, as a way to create a more integrated community within our org and, moreover, within GitHub itself.
