### Working Agreements

Working agreements, also known as team norms, are guidelines developed by the teams as to how they must work together to create a positive, productive process. Working agreements describe positive behaviors that, although basic, often are not automatically demonstrated in team processes. For example, an agreement might be "We all agree to be punctual at meetings".

Agreements are the group's power tool. Elements of the working agreement should be posted (written out on a chart or board, or giving in a hand-out) for easy reference throughout the team process. They may be set upfront to establish a ONE team culture, and something to refer back when things get rocky within the team.

**Working agreements help teams:**

* Develop a sense of shared responsibility
* Increase members' awareness of their own behavior
* Empower the facilitator to lead the group according the agreements
* Enhance the quality of the group process

Work agreements should be reviewed at the end of every sprint during the retrospective meeting. Once team members feel they are doing well on one agreement, they can replace it with another agreement to focus on.

**Agreements work well when:**

* They are important to the team
* They are limited in number
* They are fully supported by each member
* The members are reminded of agreements during process checks
* The members are reminded of agreements when they are broken

Some examples of Team Working Agreements are Definition of Ready and Definition of Done.

### Definition of Ready

Scrum has two stable states, **Ready** and **Done**, which are linked to user stories. These two states lead to the following Scrum principle:

> *Never pull anything into a sprint that is not ready, and never let anything out of the sprint that is not done.*

The **Definition of Ready (DoR)** defines the **ready** state. In simple terms, a user story needs to meet some criteria (or conditions) before it can be picked up for a sprint. The DoR collects all the conditions necessary for a user story to be developed in the current sprint. These conditions are defined by discussion among the Team, the Product Owner, and the Scrum Master. The DoR is important so that everyone on the team is aware of when to pull a user story in which sprint.

In DoR, the team is the "client" and the product owner is the "supplier". Some examples of criteria on a DoR, defined as Team Working Agreements, can be the following: 

* *Story contains actors, problem, and value*
* *Story should fit in a sprint*
* *Story should be appropriately documented (does it require wireframes? User-journeys?)*
* *Value should be obvious, if not, it should be explicitly stated*
* *Story should have reasonable conditions of satisfaction*
* *Story should focus on problems, not solutions*

In order to come up with the DoR for a user story, the Team conducts regular backlog refinement sessions with the Product Owner. During these sessions, the Product Owner presents stories to the Team and explains them one by one. If the Team is not clear about a particular aspect of a story, the Team asks questions of the Product Owner and clears their apprehensions.

**Benefits of having an established DoR:**

* Avoids wastage of time once a story is started
* Helps the team identify when a team member becomes overwhelmed
* Reduces requirements change during development
* Keeps the team members focused and accountable to each other

In the end, a user story is ready if the Team can implement it, and the Product Owner can prioritize it.

### Definition of Done

The **Definition of Done (DoD)** is a checklist of activities that add verifiable and demonstrable value to the product, not only in terms of functionality but in terms of quality as well. Focusing on value-added steps allows the team to focus on what must be completed in order to build software while eliminating waste.

An example of Definition of Done for a feature/user story can be:

* *Writing code*
* *Coding comments*
* *Code coverage unit testing >= 80%*
* *Integration testing*
* *Release notes*
* *Design documents*

The DoD is the primary reporting mechanism for team members. Is the ability to say “This feature is done”. After all, a feature or Product Backlog Item is either done or it is not-done. The DoD is a simple artifact that adds clarity to the “Feature’s done” statement.

Scrum asks that teams deliver “potentially shippable software” at the end of every sprint. The team agrees on, and displays prominently somewhere in the team room, the list of criteria which must be met before a “potentially shippable software” is considered "done". Such teams may have a different DoD at various levels:

* Definition of Done for a **feature** (story or product backlog item)
* Definition of Done for a **sprint** (collection of features developed within a sprint)
* Definition of Done for a **release** (potentially shippable state)

The Definition of Done is not static. It changes over time. Organizational support and the team’s ability to remove impediments may enable the inclusion of additional activities into the DoD for features or sprints. Furthermore, the DoD is an auditable checklist. The features/stories are broken down into tasks both during sprint planning and also within a sprint. The DoD is used to validate whether all major tasks are accounted for (hours remaining). Also, after a feature or sprint is done, the DoD is used as a checklist to verify whether all necessary value-added activities were completed.

**Common pitfalls:**

* Obsessing over the list of criteria can be counter-productive; the list needs to define the minimum work generally required to get a product increment to the "done" state.
* Individual features or user stories may have specific "done" criteria in addition to the ones that apply to work in general.
* If the DoD is merely a shared understanding, rather than spelled out and displayed on a wall, it may lose much of its effectiveness; a good part of its value lies in being an explicit contract known to all members of the team.

**Benefits of having an established DoD:**

* Provides a checklist which usefully guides pre-implementation activities: discussion, estimation, design.
* Limits the cost of rework once a feature has been accepted as "done".
* Having an explicit contract limits the risk of misunderstanding and conflict between the Development team and the Product Owner.
