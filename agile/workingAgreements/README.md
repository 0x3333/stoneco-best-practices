### Working Agreements

Working agreements, also known as team norms, are guidelines developed by the teams as to how they must work together to create a positive, productive process. Working agreements describe positive behaviors that, although basic, often are not automatically demonstrated in team processes. For example, an agreement might be "We all agree to be punctual at meetings".

Agreements are the group's power tool. Elements of the working agreement should be posted (written out on a chart or board, or giving in a hand-out) for easy reference throughout the team process. They may be set upfront to establish a ONE team culture, and something to refer back when things get rocky within the team.

Working agreements help teams:

* **Develop a sense of shared responsibility**
* **Increase members' awareness of their own behavior**
* **Empower the facilitator to lead the group according the agreements**
* **Enhance the quality of the group process**

Work agreements should be reviewed at the end of every sprint during the retrospective meeting. Once team members feel they are doing well on one agreement, they can replace it with another agreement to focus on.

Agreements work well when:

* **They are important to the team**
* **They are limited in number**
* **They are fully supported by each member**
* **The members are reminded of agreements during process checks**
* **The members are reminded of agreements when they are broken**

Some examples of team working agreements are Definition of Ready and Definition of Done.
