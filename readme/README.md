# README.md Guideline

The main purpose behind a readme file in a GitHub repository is to present the tool to a possible new contributor and to serve as a reference guide to a regular contributor. Few things are necessary to accomplish this, which are listed below. Additions to the file are always welcome, but be aware of not making the document too cluttered.

## Necessary content for a good readme:

### Application presentation

This is as simple as describing what the application does, why it was made and how it was made. It's here where you will make people interested in using it and consequently contributing with it.

### Requirements/dependencies (if there are any)

As the title says, here you list any dependency related to using your application. Anything that wouldn't go on the Getting Started tutorial.

### Getting Started 

Guide to running your application. The entire purpose of making an application public is to allow other users to run your application on their machines. This plus the previous topic MUST allow them to do that, if it doesn't than it means you have failed on attracting contributors and users.

### Main Releases

List of previous main releases and also what is planned on the next ones. This allows the user/contributor to understand where your application is coming from and also to understand it's end goal.

### Code status

### License

The License that is attached to any code on your repository. This is essential and obligatory. Be careful when choosing your license. Also, it's good practice to refer to your license in every code file on your repository.

### Credits

Who did what. People love to be recognised for their work! Do not forget to include anyone.
